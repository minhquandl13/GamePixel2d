00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,080
hi guys, this is RyiSnow 

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:13,599
last time, we implemented boots that increase the player speed

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,720
and also implemented the music and sound effects

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,760
in this video, we will add on-screen UI

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,480
and complete this simple treasure hunting game

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,599
so let's start

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:36,800
but first, let me edit the current code a little bit since i found a little bug

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:43,120
we used this Sound class for both playing music and sound effects

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,160
but i guess that wasn't a good idea 

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:51,760
i've noticed, when the program tries to stop a music and play a sound effect at the same time

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,760
it only process one of them, not both

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,239
like, it plays sound effect but the music doesn't stop

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,760
so i decided to instantiate one more Sound class

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,560
name this "Music"

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,400
and the other one is renamed to SE

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,439
and call them separately

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,080
so for playing music and stoping music, we call this "music"

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,720
and for playing SE, we use this "se"

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:46,079
this way, even if we try to stop a music and play a sound effect at the same time, these classes handle it separately

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,200
okay let's continue

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,240
first, we create a new class inside of this "main" package

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,920
and i'm gonna name this UI

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:06,799
and this class basically handle all the on-screen UI

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:12,800
so we can display text message and item icons or stuff like that

51
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:21,200
and the constructor

59
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,280
so what are we gonna draw?

60
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:52,400
since we get keys to open doors, let's display the number of the keys that player currently has

63
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,720
and we can draw texts with this Graphics2D

65
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,120
but first, we need to set up font

66
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:07,760
to do that, we use this setFont method and pass a font here

69
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,959
you can set a font by typing like this

77
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,560
the first parameter is the font name

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:32,360
so you can use whatever font you want as long as it is supported by your computer

80
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:38,720
and the second parameter is font style

82
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:47,080
so you can choose PLAIN or ITALIC or BOLD...

85
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,080
so you can choose a font style

86
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:55,519
and the third parameter is font size

87
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:59,360
so usually this is how you set the font on this Graphics2D

90
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,080
but i don't recommend to create a new instance in game loop

92
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,080
because creating instance takes time

94
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:20,560
this draw method will be included in the game loop, so this will get called 60 times per second

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:27,680
and that means, it will create this new instance 60 times per second

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,479
and it will consume time and resource

102
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,440
so this is actually a bad example

103
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,240
so instead we declare the font here

106
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:47,680
so font and the name is like Arial 40 or something

108
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,199
then instantiate it

118
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:10,800
so we can finish the instantiation before the game loop starts

120
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,400
so now we just need to type the font name here

122
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,240
then we choose a font color

126
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,720
i'm going to choose white

128
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,560
okay now let's draw some text

131
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,680
and the first parameter is text, and x and y

133
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,520
so for the text, it will be like this

137
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,960
we're gonna display key number so...

140
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,000
okay this needs to be "public"

141
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,240
and x and y

142
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,520
maybe somewhere around here

146
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,280
now let's go to this GamePanel

147
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,360
and instantiate the UI class

148
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,199
somewhere around here

153
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,400
and pass this GamePanel

155
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:45,600
then inside of this paintComponent, we call the draw method

158
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:50,400
since usually UI comes at the top of the layers

160
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,479
so UI shouldn't be hidden by tiles or player, right?

161
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,319
so we call it after this player

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,199
okay let's check this

168
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:18,000
so the text is displayed

169
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,440
but there is a catch here 

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,280
although we typed x50 and y50, but this doesn't look like it

173
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:33,440
that's because this drawString's y-coordinate works in a bit different way 

175
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:40,160
usually in Java, when you set y, it indicates the top of the image or object

178
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,080
but for some reason, 

179
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:49,199
when you use drawString the y indicates not the top but the baseline of the text

181
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,039


182
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:59,120
so drawImages y and drawString's y indicate different spots

185
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,479
so this is really confusing

186
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:08,160
if it indicates a bottom of the object, it's still relatively easy to handle

188
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:13,599
but as you can see from this image, the baseline is not the bottom

190
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:17,840
it's somewhere slightly higher than the bottom

192
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:24,840
i don't know why it works this way but sadly that's how it works

194
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,919
so we need to keep this in mind and adjust the position

196
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,360


197
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,360
so maybe i want to move this to the left a little bit

200
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,240
so i think i'm going to decrease this x a little bit

202
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,720
yeah i think i like this better

203
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:50,080
but still this looks kind of too generic 

205
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:55,680
so i think it might be better if we display a key image instead of this text

207
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:04,880
and we can get it from this OBJ_Key class

211
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:09,040
but again, don't instantiate the class here

213
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:13,440
instead, let's declare a BufferedImage here

217
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:23,200
and then instantiate the key class here

224
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,640
and get the key image

227
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:53,680
so we can prepare this image before the game loop starts

229
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,480
then we're gonna draw this image

232
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:07,279
and x and y will be something like half tile size

234
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,600
something like this

236
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,440
so it means 24 pixels

241
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,519
so after this image we add a text

242
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:42,560
we don't need this but instead something like this

245
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:49,440
so x is 24+48, so 72

250
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,600
we add 2 pixel space

251
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:03,440
and Y is... i don't know, let's check

254
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,600
so bit lower

255
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,320
maybe 65 or something

257
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,800
yeah something like this

260
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,200
okay looks good

262
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,959
now let's display some notification message

263
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:40,000
when we pick up these keys or boots or when we try to open the door

266
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:45,519
so inside of this UI class, we create some variables

272
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,800
the default is false

276
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,959
blank for now

277
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,959
and then create a method

281
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,720
we get a String

292
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,560
and now go to this Player class

295
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,880
when we get the key...

296
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,160
we don't need this System.out.println anymore

299
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:54,160
so when we get the key, we call this showMessage method

302
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,800
and pass some text... whatever you want to display

305
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,440
so like "you got a key!"

309
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:19,360
so this method receives the text, and put it in this message string

313
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,800
and change this messageOn to "true"

314
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:28,639
now inside of this draw method, we create an if statement

320
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,480
then we draw the message

326
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,720
so i wanna display it somewhere around here

331
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,360
half tileSize or something

332
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:13,760
but basically you can type any number so it's totally up to you

339
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,079
5 tiles to the bottom

340
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:31,120
and also maybe reduce the font size a little bit

342
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:35,279
so we can create another font and change the size

344
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:45,760
but if a font is already set, we can change the size by typing like this

352
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,000
so we get the current font and then...

356
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:04,880
and here we type number and it accepts "float" so we add "f"

360
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,800
alright let's check this

363
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:25,760
so the message is displayed but right now, it keeps staying on the screen

365
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:33,360
so i think it would be better if the message disappears after a while

368
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,279
so let's do that

369
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,279
we're gonna create another variable

373
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,560
and start from 0

375
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:55,839
so every time this draw method gets called, we increase the counter

384
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:15,040
when the counter hits a certain number, we stop displaying the text

394
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,360
so this means 120 frames 

395
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,920
and this is 60 frames per second so this means 2 seconds

397
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,959
so the text disappears after 2 seconds

399
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,000
so let's check this

400
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,690
[Music]

402
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,000
yeah looks good

403
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,279
let's add some more text

404
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,360
when you open the door...

407
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:10,640
"You opened the door!"

412
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:21,520
also, when you don't have a key...

413
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,520
okay let's create "else"

414
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,640
"You need a key!"

415
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:38,720
and when you get the boots... "Speed up!"

417
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,919
okay let's check

427
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,720
alright looking good 

428
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,520
so now we only need to take care of this treasure chest

431
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,480
so let's create the final case

436
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,919
so if you get this treasure chest, you beat the game

438
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,039
so we want to stop the game

442
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,520
let's go to the UI class 

443
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:02,600
and in this UI class, we need to tell the program the game is finished

452
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:15,039
and the default is false

453
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,600
and go back to this Player class

454
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:22,000
and when you get this treasure chest...

459
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:33,039
and also we're gonna stop the music

461
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:41,679
and play a sound effect

466
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,960
so this one... "fanfare"

469
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,559
so the index is 4

470
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,240
not playerSE

471
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,799
playSE

473
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,559
let's not forget to "break"

475
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:16,559
in this UI class, we check if the game is finished or not

483
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,480
then we do something

485
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,840
so we put everything else in this "else"

487
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:47,440
okay here, we're gonna display some congratulations kind of message

489
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:52,799
and we want to display this message around the center of the screen

491
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:59,120
we can find out the coordinates of the center by typing like this

500
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:25,120
but this doesn't work because, this means the text starts from here

504
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:33,039
so the text will be displayed at the right side of the screen

507
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:36,640
so we need to do a little adjustment

508
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:42,799
first, we find out the length of the text that we're gonna display

510
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,400
so let me create some more variables

519
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,600
like this

521
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,320
also let's copy these two lines

523
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:23,919
we need to set a font and a font color

525
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,919
and we input some text

527
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:34,000
"You found the treasure!"

528
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:38,080
now we're gonna check the length of this text

530
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,679
to do that...

543
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,559
and here, first we're gonna pass this text

547
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,600
and the context is g2

552
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:34,559
it looks a bit complicated but basically this returns the length of this text

556
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:46,640
and now we subtract... the half of this text length

559
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:51,760
so this way the text will be aligned to the center

562
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,200
let's adjust this y coordinates as well

563
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:02,559
because the player character is displayed at the center

565
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,720
and i don't want to hide him with the text

567
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:10,880
so we decrease the Y a little bit

572
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:26,159
we can adjust it later 

573
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,120
so we can finally draw the string

577
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,799
the first one is text and x and y

580
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,640
we're gonna display one more line, "congratulations"-kind of message

582
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:51,279
and for this one i think we're gonna use a bit larger font

587
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,320
first let's declare another font

591
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,200
and we're gonna use not PLAIN but BOLD

593
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:14,880
i'm gonna name this "80B" so it's easy to understand what it is

596
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,440
and instantiate the font

599
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,559
the size is 80 and the style is BOLD

606
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:42,080
after displaying this "You found the treasure!"...

608
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,919
okay let's copy this

609
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:49,039
so change it to arial_80B

613
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:56,880
and let's change the font color as well

616
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:04,640
i think we can copy this and the paste

619
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:10,720
the text is "Congratulations!"

621
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,919
and get the text length

622
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:17,600
x is the same and we only need to adjust this y

625
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,400
so this time, we gonna display a bit lower than the center

627
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,480
so not minus but plus... probably 2 tiles

630
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:38,720
and finally, we're gonna stop the game

632
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:46,799
so after drawing these strings, we're gonna call this gameThread and put "null"

637
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,039
so this stops the thread

639
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,039
we are done

640
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,039
let's check

651
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,559
everything works good

652
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:39,520
we found three keys, opened three doors, and found the treasure

654
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:44,559
so basically this is it, but i want to add a final touch

656
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:51,760
what we're gonna do is, displaying the playtime on the screen

658
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,480
so you can see how long it took to find the treasure

661
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,159
so inside of this UI class...

665
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,240
we use double so we can display decimal too

667
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,039
i think that's more interesting

669
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,960
somewhere around here i think

671
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:34,720
we gonna add 1/60 seconds to this playTime

675
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,799
this draw method gets called 60 times per second

677
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:43,039
so we add 1/60 seconds in every loop

680
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:48,799
then we're going to display the time on the screen

687
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,440
i think i want to display it around here so

690
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:20,240
and screen width is 16 tiles so... minus 5?

692
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,000
11 tiles to the right

694
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,480
we're going to use the same y-coordinates as this key

697
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,640
something like this

698
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,919
okay let's check this

702
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,559
so the playtime is displayed

704
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,840
but so many decimals

705
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,840
this doesn't look so good

706
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:57,600
so let's format this number a little bit

707
00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:02,320
and to format this decimal values, there is a nice class

714
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:16,960
so we're gonna use this class to format

717
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,840
and inside of this constructor we can type like this

721
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:37,679
so this means, we display up to tow places of decimals

724
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,640
so if you want to display three, then you can type like this

726
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,120
and let's edit this

727
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:56,559
not just playtime but we use this dFormat

734
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,060
so let's check this

735
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,919
alright

737
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:19,840
and finally, i wanna display your playtime when you finish the game

740
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,840
so let's copy

750
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:51,279
the place is... around here

758
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,600
plus 3 tiles i guess

759
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,600
maybe 4

761
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,840
i guess this is everything

762
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,840
okay so let's check

764
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,349
so how long it's gonna take

765
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,349
[Music]

766
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,799
i think this is the fastest route 

767
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,710
so first you get the boots

768
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:39,600
and get two other keys

769
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:40,840
[Music]

772
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,039
oh come on

773
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,240
i'm losing time

775
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:01,760
okay so my time was 35.93 seconds

778
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,360
alright

781
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,640
let me try this again 

782
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,640
i think i can do this better

783
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,520

784
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:31,519
[Music]

786
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,679
alright

787
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,840
[Music]

788
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,960
looking good

789
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,960
okay looks good

790
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,360
oh

791
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:51,120
much better, 31.70 seconds

793
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,200
okay so that's it

794
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,679
you know the game is pretty straightforward

796
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:03,679
but depending on how you construct your map or game

799
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:09,679
you might be able to enjoy kind of intense time attack gameplay or something

802
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:14,879
anyway, this is the end of the first half of this Java 2D game tutorial

804
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,679
thank you so much for watching 

805
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,159
in the second half we will add a lot more elements

806
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,639
such as NPCs and monsters and the battle...

808
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:28,960
and change this into action RPG

810
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:32,159
so if you are interested please keep watching

812
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,839
i promise it will be pretty good

813
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,079
alright that's it for now

814
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:41,079
thanks again and until next time

815
