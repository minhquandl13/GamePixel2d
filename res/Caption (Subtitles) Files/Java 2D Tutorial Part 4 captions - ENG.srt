1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,839
last time we loaded the character sprites

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:16,240
and implemented a simple animation system so we can control our player character

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,720
now let's draw some background tiles 

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:27,599
by the way, we don't need these variables anymore since we took care of the player movement in Player class

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,599
so you can delete this

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:37,760
so first we need some background tile images

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,280
so i prepared three tiles

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:45,840
we will add more tiles later but for now three tiles should be enough

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:50,559
so inside of this resource package let's create another package

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,039
i'm gonna name this "tiles"

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:04,399
and we're gonna copy these tile images to the tiles package

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:15,920
and then from this source folder we're gonna create another package

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:27,560
and inside of this tile package, create a class called Tile

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:37,600
and this is a class which represents a single tile

33
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,840
and for now we add two elements 

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,159
the one is...

38
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,680
and the other one is...

43
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,439
so this class is okay for now

44
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,959
now let's create another class

45
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,120
inside of this tile package

46
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,280
i'm gonna name this TileManager

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,239
in this class, first we're gonna use GamePanel

52
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,000
and also this Tile class

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,840
we create this Tile as an alley and name this "tile"

57
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,319
import GamePanel

58
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,879
then let's create a constructor

60
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,200
and we're gonna get GamePanel as "gp"

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,080
also we're gonna set the size of this Tile array

67
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,360
i'm gonna choose 10 for now 

68
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,319
this means we're going to create 10 kinds of tiles

70
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:22,000
so like a glass tile, a water tile, a wall tile...

72
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:31,120
if we need more then we can always change this number to like 15 or 20

75
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:35,200
but i think 10 is enough

76
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:39,120
then create a method

78
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,480
and we're gonna call this method from this constructor

81
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,560
kind of similar to the Player class

82
00:03:51,920 --> 00:04:01,840
so we're gonna load these tile images in this getTileImage method 

84
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,840
so again, try and catch

88
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:22,400
and here so we're gonna instantiate this Tile array

101
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,280
and then type a file path

103
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:58,000
so the file path will be... since these are inside of this tiles package so...

108
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:12,240
so we created this BufferedImage inside of this Tile class

111
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:20,240
we're gonna put this tile file image into this BufferedImage

114
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,639
let's copy this and paste

119
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:36,840
and the tile[1] will be wall

121
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:42,160
and the tile[2] will be water

123
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,479
instantiation is done

124
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:54,560
and we create a draw method inside of this TileManager too

132
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,639
import

133
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,919
so let's draw a tile for testing

134
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,440
so to draw a tile, type like this 

139
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,639
so first a BufferedImage

141
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,759
so let's draw this grass tile

144
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:34,560
and then x and y, so 0 and 0

146
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:44,000
and width and height, so gp.tileSize and gp.tileSize

149
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:46,479
and the ImageObserver is null

151
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,639
and now let's go to this GamePanel class

153
00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:00,840
instantiate this TileManager

160
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:14,160
and pass this GamePanel class

163
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:22,880
then inside of this paintComponent we're gonna type...

167
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:30,400
so we're gonna call this draw method inside of the TileManager

170
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:38,560
and make sure to type this line before this "player.draw(g2)"

173
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:43,919
so it's like a layer. in this case we draw tiles first, then player

175
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:55,360
if it's opposite, background tiles will hide player character so we cannot see player character

179
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:58,840
so make sure to draw tiles before player

180
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,840
let's check this

181
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,800
yeah okay

182
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,879
so our first tile is displayed

183
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,599
so let's draw some more tiles

184
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,120
so go back to this TileManager class

185
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:16,479
let's copy this and paste it

187
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:24,960
draw a wall tile and a water tile

190
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:29,840
but we have to change this x and y otherwise it's just overwrite

192
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,560
so let's add a tile size to x

195
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:46,480
and add tile size again so 48 plus 48 will be 96

198
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,279
okay let's check this

199
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:56,560
alright. so we have drawn a grass tile, a wall tile, and a water tile

204
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,640
like this, we can draw tiles on the screen

207
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,680
so let's check this

208
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,360
alright

210
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:33,200
i just created 5 tiles horizontally, 5 tiles vertically

213
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,399
that's what i typed

214
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:44,320
but obviously this is not the efficient way of typing or drawing

218
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,160
it's just too much typing

219
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:53,279
so we need more efficient tile drawing system

221
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,120
so let's not do this

222
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:00,399
instead, we will create a while loop

223
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:06,399
and kind of automate the process so we can avoid a lot of typing

225
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,720
first create some variables

235
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,800
then create a while loop

237
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:41,920
so this loop continues if col is smaller than gp.max...

241
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,120
oh okay

242
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,640
ah sorry

243
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,480
we need to change these variables to "public"

253
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,680
and also this integer row is smaller than...

258
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,959
so inside of this loop we're gonna draw tiles

262
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,839
so for now let's draw a grass tile

268
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,120
these are variables

271
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,959
okay

272
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,600
first, col is 0 and row is 0 

274
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,639
and x is 0 and y is 0

275
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,399
basically this is 0:0

276
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,720
so it's gonna draw a tile at 0:0

277
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,720
here

278
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,920
after that we're gonna increase this col by 1

280
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,560
and then we're going to increase this x

288
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,720
so we increase this col one by one 

289
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:43,120
and if this hits this maxScreenCol which is 16

291
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:49,120
then we're gonna reset this col and also reset this x

293
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:54,639
and then increase this row by 1

295
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,160
and also increase this y position

299
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,880
okay i think. let's check this

301
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:20,160
so we have succeeded to place tiles on the whole screen

304
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,320
but we are only using the grass tile

305
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:27,519
so to render an actual map, we create a map data first

307
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:34,399
then let this loop read the data

309
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:38,480
and to store this map data we use a text file

311
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:44,560
it's a simple method but also pretty popular and effective method as well

313
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:50,000
so first open this notepad

315
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,279
and then we're gonna type...

320
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:10,399
and we're gonna copy this and paste 11 times

323
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:18,720
so a single line has 16 zeros and it has 12 lines

325
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:24,320
and each number represents a tile

327
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:33,040
so this is a 16x12 tile map which is the same size as our screen

329
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:38,320
and this 0 means tile number so it's a grass tile

331
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,800
so if you want to place a wall tile you just need to change this to 1

334
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:52,160
and if we want to place a water tile, change the number to 2

338
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,639
let me create a sample map real quick

340
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,839
something like this

341
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,839
now let's save the file

342
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:23,040
i'm gonna name this just "map01.txt"

346
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,440
then inside of this res folder, create another package

349
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,920
i'm going to name this "maps"

351
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:46,240
where's the file?

354
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:54,600
okay so we're gonna copy this map file to this "maps" folder

358
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:03,839
so we got this map data file so let's load this data

360
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,839
first, create a variable

367
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,959
and this is going to be an array

369
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:27,839
and inside of this constructor we're gonna instantiate this mapTileNum

373
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,600
and the size is...

379
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:54,959
so basically we're gonna put all these numbers to this mapTileNum array

383
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:59,519
so to do that, we're gonna create another method

388
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,240
so another try and catch

389
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,120
this time just "Exception e"

392
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,480
we're gonna use this InputStream class

397
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:41,520
and here we're gonna type the file path of this text file

406
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,360
and import this InputStream

421
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,280
import this

423
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,520
and also this

426
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:33,840
so we used this InputStream to import this text file

428
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:42,400
and we're gonna use this BufferedReader to read the content of this text file

431
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:45,760
it's just a format to read this text file

433
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:53,520
and after this, again we're going to create an integer "col"

436
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:57,440
start from 0 and integer row, start from 0

438
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,760
and while loop again

441
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,559
so smaller than maxScreenColl 

442
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:19,280
and also row is smaller than gp.maxScreenRow

447
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,840
inside of this while loop we're gonna read this text file

449
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:30,080
and maxScreenCol or maxScreenRow is the limit of this loop

451
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:35,360
because it has no data beyond that boundary

459
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,600
so this BufferedReader can read text files

460
00:19:48,400 --> 00:20:02,000
and this readLine means it's gonna read a single line

463
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:05,679
and put it into this String "line"

464
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:14,559
and once we read the line, we enter another while loop

477
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:40,000
and double quotations and a space

479
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:43,600
so what we are doing here is,

480
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:49,840
from the line we just read, we're gonna get these numbers one by one

483
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:56,320
and put them into this alley

485
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:03,480
and then we're gonna create this integer variable and name this "num"

493
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:20,159
and the index is "col"

494
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:27,760
so basically we are changing this from String to Integer

496
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:31,679
this readLine only get the data as String

497
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:37,919
and we split this line and this is also String 

499
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,120
so we need to change this from String to Integer

500
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,360
so we can use them as a number

502
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:49,120
then we're gonna use this mapTileNum integer

508
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,679
the index is col and row

511
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,960
after this we're gonna increase this col by 1

513
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:13,720
and then if this col hits the maxScreenCol

525
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:37,679
finally we're gonna close this BufferedReader because we're not gonna use this

528
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:43,039
so basically we're gonna scan this text file line by line

530
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:48,799
so first this line and divide it to each number

532
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:54,880
and get them to the mapTileNum

534
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,200
and once finish this line then 

535
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,080
go to the next line and the next...

537
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,000
until this loop is over

538
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:11,840
so now we should be able to load this map data

540
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:19,360
so let's draw the loaded map data

542
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,159
we just need to arrange this while loop a little bit

543
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:28,480
instead of this fixed image, first we delete this 

545
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,280
and also i think we're gonna create an integer

553
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,000
so again we start from 0

556
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:57,360
we're gonna extract a number from this mapTileNum and get this as a tile number

559
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,720
then we're gonna draw an image

563
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:12,720
so this is gonna work as an index of this Tile array

569
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:23,360
so if we get the number 0 from this

572
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,799
it's gonna draw a grass tile 

573
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,960
and if we get 1 from this alley then

574
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,679
it's gonna draw a wall tile

575
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,440
if it was 2 then it's gonna draw a water tile

576
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:41,919
so everything is stored inside of this mapTileNum array

580
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,400
now this should be okay so let's check this

582
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,240
oops

583
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,480
why

584
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,480
ah

585
00:24:50,559 --> 00:25:02,400
okay we didn't call this load map method

589
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,240
this should be okay

590
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,279
let's check

591
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,120
alright

594
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:18,080
so we succeeded to draw a map file

596
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,880
looks nice i think

597
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:34,000
also i just remembered one more thing

600
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,279
yeah this is just fine but...

602
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:48,400
probably it would be better if we just pass a String here

606
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:55,440
we're gonna pass this path information from here and get it as a String

613
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,440
and put it here

614
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:14,000
because maybe you will create a different map later

618
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,480
so map02, map03 map04...

619
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,960
and whenever you want to load a different map

621
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,360
you just need to call this loadMap and type the file path here

623
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,840
so you don't have to create another loadMap method

627
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:42,159
anyway we have succeeded to load our map file and draw the tiles on the screen

630
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:49,440
but still it's a small map

631
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:54,159
it's only as large as a single screen

633
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:05,360
so next time we will create a world map that we will actually use it in our game

636
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:14,880
and implement a game camera so the background tiles change according to the player character's movement

640
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,880
thanks for watching and until next time

642
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:27,760
