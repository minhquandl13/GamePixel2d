00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,920
hi guys, this is RyiSnow

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:12,080
so last time we succeeded to draw these background tiles

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:19,439
but this is just a small sample map and the size is only as large as the game screen

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,880
if single screen is all you need for your game, this might be okay

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:34,480
but what we are trying to create, ultimately, in this tutorial is a 2D action RPG

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,360
so we want to have a larger map

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,840
so in this video we will create a world map and draw it on the screen

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:47,840
and to create a world map, i have prepared a few extra tiles

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,520
tree, sand, and earth (dirt)

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:59,840
so let's copy these to this "tiles" package

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,199
and let's load these new tiles

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:12,880
so let's copy this and add three more

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:40,840
now we can use these tiles too

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,840
and this is the world map i created

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,479
it's a 50 by 50 tile map

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,119
of course you can create your own map

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:56,399
and if you want to create a larger map, you can do that

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:03,920
and before loading and drawing this world map file, we need to do some adjustment

49
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,280
what we're gonna do is, we edit the code in the Player class

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:13,200
so instead of moving around on the screen

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,360
the player character will always be displayed at the center

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:25,599
and we will expand the boundary of our tile drawing loop

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:33,920
our current tile drawing system is set for drawing tiles as large as our screen size

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:39,280
and that's not enough to draw our world map so we change it

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:46,080
and when these two steps are done we can display our world map and move around it

66
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,200
so let's get to the step one

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,720
let's go to this Entity class

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:03:00,640
and we're gonna rename this x and y to worldX and worldY

73
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,680
how to say... just for better understanding

74
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:08,239
because we are going to use two kinds of x and y

76
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,000
the one is worldX and worldY

77
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:15,120
and this one is screenX and screenY

79
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,599
these are different and indicate different coordinates

81
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:28,400
and understanding this difference will be the key to understand the mechanics of game camera

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:33,360
okay then let's go to this Player class

86
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,879
and the rename this x and y too

90
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,000
wait what

93
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,080
what is this

96
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,280
sorry

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,040
and this one too

102
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,120
we leave this for now

103
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,640
because we're gonna use a different kind of x and y here

107
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:31,199
so in this Player class, rename this x and y in the setDefaultValues

109
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,199
and also x and y in this update method

110
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:41,040
and this worldX and worldY are not screen position

112
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,479
this is not where we draw on the screen

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,840
this is the player's position on the world map

115
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,400
and i want to change this default player position

117
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,160
so this is going to be the starting point

119
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,759
i want to start the game at this point

122
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:13,520
so this is gonna be... 23 

127
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:18,080
so instead of this 100 100 we're gonna type...

135
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,240
this is gonna be the starting position

136
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,639
then in this Player class, we create another x and y variables

146
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:02,960
so now we have worldX, worldY and screenX, screenY

149
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:11,440
and screenX and screenY indicate where we draw player on the screen

152
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:19,520
so we place this player character at the center of the screen and scroll the background as he moves

155
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,840
that's what we're gonna do

167
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,479
so this returns the halfway point of the screen

169
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:58,560
so when we draw this player character,

171
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:08,160
instead of this x and y, let's replace them with screenX and screenY

175
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:13,280
this screenX and screenY don't change throughout the game

177
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,440
these are "final" variables

179
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,319
so the player character's screen position doesn't change

181
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,319
okay let's check this

185
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:35,840
so now player's position is fixed at the center of the screen or...

188
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,080
actually, this is not the center of the screen

191
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:46,639
these two variables indicate the center of the screen for sure

193
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:57,360
but the problem is, these coordinates are used for the top left corner of the image

198
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:03,280
so we need to do a little adjustment

200
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,720
from this value we're going to subtract...

204
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,120
and this too

205
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,120
alright let's check

207
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,720
can you see the difference?

209
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:31,919
now the player character is displayed at the center of the screen

211
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,800
so the step one is done

212
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,320
let's get to the step two

214
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:44,880
let's go to this GamePanel and we create some world map parameters

243
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:42,720
as i said you can change these numbers as you like

246
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,600
i think this GamePanel class is okay

247
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,200
so let's go to the TileManager class

248
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:58,880
and we're gonna change the size of this mapTileNum too

251
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:07,760
we're gonna change this from maxScreenCol to maxWorldCol

254
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:12,079
and this is also maxWorldRow

256
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:19,240
and let's change this file path too

261
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,279
and in this loadMap method, 

262
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:35,519
we're gonna change maxScreenCol to maxWorldCol

266
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:48,959
and maxScreenRow to maxWorldRow

268
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,079
so basically we are doing a larger loop here

269
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:58,959
so in the previous loop, the screen size was the boundaries

271
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,200
but now the world map is the boundaries

272
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:09,040
now we move on to the draw method and do some arrangement

276
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:16,000
and this is gonna be a little bit complicated because we're gonna implement a camera function

279
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,160
first we're gonna delete this x and y

281
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:25,760
so we're not gonna use this x and y in this loop

283
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:32,000
and delete this and this and this too

287
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:44,640
then we're gonna change this col and row to worldCol and worldRow

292
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,480
so copy this worldCol and paste here

299
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:12,639
and also let's change this maxScreenCol to maxWorldCol

306
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,519
and now a tricky part 

307
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,240
ultimately, there are three things that we want to know

309
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:34,079
tile image and where to draw the tile on the screen

313
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,880
and we already know what kind of tile image it is going to display

316
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:46,240
and to find out this x and y, we type like this:

344
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,000
wait... this is not public?

346
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,600
why i'm seeing the error

348
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,680
oh okay, sorry

349
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,079
we need to set this as public

352
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,240
then one more variable

360
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,600
why i always type like this...

362
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,480
and we're gonna paste this screenX and screenY here

365
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:44,160
let me explain about this part

366
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:47,199
first we check the tile's worldX 

367
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,000
so that is worldCol x tileSize

368
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,519
so

369
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,399
if it's a [0][0] tile, 

372
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,120
it's gonna be a 0 x 48 and 0 x 48

374
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,279
so x and y are also 0 0

376
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:08,160
and if it's a [1][0] tile,

378
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,680
which means this one

379
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:18,399
then worldX will be 1 x 48 so worldX will be 48

381
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,639
and worldY is still 0

382
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:27,839
then we need to know where on the screen we need to draw it

384
00:15:24,240 --> 000:15:32,800
again, this screenX is different from worldX

386
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,600
worldX is the position on the map 

387
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,360
and screenX is where on the screen we draw it

389
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:48,000
imagine, if player is at worldX 500 and worldY 500

392
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:55,920
then player is 500 pixels away from this [0][0] tile

395
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,120
let's say it's around here

396
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:11,040
then this [0][0] tile should be drawn at 500 pixels to the left and 500 pixels to the top from the player

401
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:22,000
that's why we subtract the player's worldX and worldY from the tile's worldX and worldY

406
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,560
and that returns the tile's screen position

408
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:37,040
so if player's position is 500:500 then this tile's screen position will be the x minus 500 and y minus 500

412
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,279
so basically it's out of our game window

414
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:51,839
then why we add this player's screenX and screenY?

418
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,399
there is a little catch here 

419
00:16:51,839 --> 00:17:01,519
so remember, the player's screen position is always at the center of the screen

421
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:05,839
for example, screenX 0 and screenY 0 means the top left corner

424
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,199
here

426
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,079
and it becomes minus (from here)

427
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,280
so 0:0 is here

428
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:20,640
even if player is standing at worldX 0 and worldY 0

431
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,880
still, he is displayed at the center of the screen 

433
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,480
not here

434
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:33,720
so we need to offset this difference

435
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,720
so we add this to the calculation

436
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,320
adding this, we can offset the difference

437
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:47,039
and we can get correct coordinates for this tile's screenX and screenY

439
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:53,919
i hope you understand and it's okay even if you still feel "uh... what?"

442
00:17:51,440 --> 00:18:02,080
i was like that, it took me a while to wrap my head around this

445
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,360
so it's okay for now, just copy and paste this code

446
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:10,880
but i hope you will get it eventually and i think you will

448
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,120
and i hope my explanation was enough

449
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,120
yeah this is complicated

450
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:20,240
anyways so we found out a tile's screenX and screenY

452
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:26,320
so after drawing a tile we increase this worldCol by 1

454
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,280
so we can draw the next tile

455
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,880
and if worldCol hits this maxWorldCol...

456
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,919
yeah we draw one by one

457
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,960
and when we hit this tile

460
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:46,320
we reset col and increase row so we move here

462
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,720
and draw this line and this line...

465
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:57,919
okay so this should work now so let's check it

467
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,320
i hope this works

470
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,160
so now we are exploring the world now

471
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:22,360
so this is the world map that i created

473
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,360
of course, there is no collision yet

474
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,039
so this is working

475
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:38,000
but we can add a little more touch to improve our rendering efficiency

477
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,440
you can continue as it is 

478
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,120
but i recommend you to do this to avoid a slow game performance

481
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:55,200
maybe you have noticed but right now this while loop is drawing all the tiles on the map

483
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:04,000
that means it is drawing tiles that we cannot see on the screen too

486
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,240
and that's not so efficient

487
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,360
this is still a relatively a small map

488
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,760
but when you have a very large map, it can slow the game down

491
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:20,400
so we only need to draw the tiles that we can see

494
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:26,559
we don't need to draw a tile which is 500 pixels away from the player

496
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,960
so this is the final touch

497
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:34,400
with this our tile drawing system will be complete so please stick with me

499
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:41,440
so before drawing a tile we add this if statement

537
00:21:52,400 --> 00:22:03,520
and we're gonna put this drawImage method in this if statement

541
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,760
okay that's it

542
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:12,240
what this if statement means is, basically we create a boundary

544
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,039
that is from the center of the screen minus player screenX

545
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,400
and plus player screenX

547
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,960
and minus player screenY, and plus player screenY

549
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:31,200
so as long as a tile is in this boundary, we draw it

552
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,200
so let's check this

553
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,520
okay, like this

557
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:54,320
so now we can see that the program is only drawing the tiles around the player

559
00:22:51,840 --> 00:23:03,280
but i guess we should expand the boundary a bit more since we are seeing the black background

563
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:09,760
so why don't we expand this boundary by 1 tile to each direction

567
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,280
to do that, we just...

570
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:22,400
i don't like this format for some reason...

573
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:32,799
okay so to do that, we add this worldX and tileSize

578
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:42,159
and this one is...

585
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,799
okay this should be okay

586
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,799
so let's check this

589
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,840
now it looks the same as before

590
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:17,919
but actually it's only drawing the tiles around the player so we can cut some extra processing

594
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:24,159
so now the program is drawing the world map and we can move around it

596
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,520
but of course, there is no collision happening yet

599
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,480
so every tile is passable

601
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,679
so next time, we will implement collision detection

603
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,679
thanks for watching and see you again

605
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:50,559
