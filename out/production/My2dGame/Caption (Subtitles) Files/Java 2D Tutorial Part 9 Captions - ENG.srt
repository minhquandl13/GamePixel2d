00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,040
hi guys, this is RyiSnow

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,440
last time, we implemented object collision

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,639
and now we can pick up keys and open doors

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,720
in this video we will create one more item

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,800
then implement music and sound effect

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:28,000
so we are very close to the end of the first half of this tutorial

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:33,040
so first, let's create another object class

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:39,680
inside of this object package, create a class

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,160
and name this OBJ_Boots

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:59,840
and we can borrow the format from other object class

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,840
so like this one

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,760
and change the name

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:23,439
and for the image we use this "boots.png" that we copied in part 7

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:33,920
okay now go to the AssetSetter

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,439
and instantiate this boots

36
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:44,560
so copy this and change the index

40
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,040
okay so the placement...

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,560
i want to place the boots around here

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,840
so column 37 and row 42

47
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:09,119
alright then go to this Player class

49
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,440
and we set the object's reaction

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,480
add another case

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:26,239
since this is boots, let's increase the player's movement speed

62
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,760
and delete this object

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,239
okay let's check this

65
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,519
got the key and the boots

66
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,400
get the boots and the speed up

67
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,400
now we can move faster

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:15,480
you can make it even faster by changing this number like this

72
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,599
but you know moving faster is not always a good idea

74
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,840
so as you can see

75
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,042
if player moves too fast then the control becomes very difficult

78
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,840
so 4 is definitely too fast 

79
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:53,519
so i'm gonna set this 2 or maybe 1 is enough

81
00:03:50,480 --> 00:04:02,879
also as an alternative idea, maybe you can create an item which makes the player slower

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,120
like a penalty item or something 

85
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:12,000
it's all up to you so i hope you come up with some interesting ideas

88
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:17,440
okay now implementing music and sound effect

90
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:23,759
first, we create another package in the res folder

92
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,800
and i'm gonna name this "sound"

95
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,479
and here i have prepared some sound files

97
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,040
and these are all WAV file

99
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,960
unfortunately the default java library cannot load mp3

100
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,000
so make sure to prepare the sound as WAV file

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,120
it's a bit inconvenient but that's how it is

104
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,479
this one is music

106
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,280
it's kind of a theme song of this game 

107
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,280
i made this with beatbox

109
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:21,759
and these are sound effects so copy these files to this package

113
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,880
and create a class in the main package

117
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,400
and name this Sound

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,720
okay first, we declare this Clip

122
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,680
we use this to open audio files

123
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,039
and import

124
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,560
and then URL

126
00:05:51,120 --> 00:06:00,160
i'm gonna name this soundURL and use this as an alley

130
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,319
i think 30 is enough

132
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:17,759
we use this URL to store the file path of these sound files

135
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,199
i'll show you how it's done

136
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,759
okay let's create a constructor 

138
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:34,080
and here we use this URL array

140
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,440
and get the file path

144
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,800
so here we type a file pass

145
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:52,240
so for this one...

156
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,520
and the second one is...

164
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,199
so we got these file paths 

165
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,400
and now we create four methods

166
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,440
and the first one is setFile

174
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,400
alright first, setFile method

176
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:12,280
we get integer as an argument

178
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,280
and try and catch

180
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:29,520
and here, we use a class called AudioInputStream

192
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,959
and import

193
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,560
and to this get AudioInputStream, we pass an URL

198
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,519
and we get the index of this sound URL array from here

210
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:28,480
so this is like a format to open an audio file in Java

212
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,560
so this setFile method is done

214
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:40,399
so whenever we want to play a sound file we call display method

216
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,240
and what we're gonna do here is...

219
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,360
and for this loop...

224
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:06,800
and when we want to stop the sound, we call this method

226
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,800
and here we type clip.stop

228
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,839
that's all about this Sound class

230
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,640
let's go to this GamePanel class

232
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,320
and instantiate this Sound class

236
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,880
okay so let's instantiate the Sound class here

242
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,399
and we don't need to pass anything

243
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,720
i'm gonna move this gameThread here

245
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,519
yeah like this

246
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:00,959
and by the way, we created this worldWidth and worldHeight a long time ago

248
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,839
i thought we're gonna use this eventually

249
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:12,959
but come to think of it, i can't think of any situation that we use this

252
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,839
so you can delete this if you want

253
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,720
sorry about that

254
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,079
so we instantiated this Sound class

256
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:26,240
then create three methods in this GamePanel

259
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,680
maybe after this paintComponent

260
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,000
the first one is...

264
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:50,880
from here, first we're gonna call the setFile in the Sound class

267
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,839
yeah this one

268
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,920
and then call the play method

272
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,680
then call the loop method

274
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,560
so when we play music, first we set a file

276
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,920
then play and then loop

277
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,959
and the next method is...

279
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:29,279
and for this one we just call this stop method

281
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:34,079
and finally, playSE

284
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,839
and for this one too we get an integer

285
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:52,480
and okay here, first we call the setFile again

287
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,000
and pass this index of the array

291
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,399
for sound effects we don't call this loop

292
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:10,320
because usually sound effect is very short and we don't need to loop it

296
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,880
alright then let's play a music

298
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,000
so this oneã€€"Blue Boy Adventure"

301
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:31,680
so we call this playMusic method from here maybe

304
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,120
around here

308
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:44,399
and we're gonna pass integer as an index

310
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:50,079
and since we want to play this song so the index is 0

312
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,440
so we pass 0 here

315
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:05,680
so this playMusic method receive 0

316
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,839
and pass 0 to this setFile

318
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:09,760
and this setFile put 0 in this soundURL

321
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,160
let's check

322
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:33,510
so now we can hear a background music

324
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,510
[Music]

326
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,160
and next let's play sound effect

327
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,120
so for example

328
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:47,680
in this Player class, we can play a sound effect when we get this key

331
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:58,639
so this time we call this playSE method

335
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:02,079
and index is this one

336
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:08,000
so this time we will play this coin sound

338
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:14,399
so the index is 1, so we pass 1 here

340
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,399
and for the door, let's copy this

341
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:24,160
door sound is this one, the door unlock sound

343
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,160
so we pass 3

344
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,920
and boots

346
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:37,199
for this one, we're gonna play this power up sound

348
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,199
so the index is 2

350
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,519
so play number 2 sound effect

351
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,160
okay let's check this

353
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,920
got the key

354
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:06,160
[Music]

355
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,160
speed up

356
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,240
okay let's open the door

357
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:15,120
[Music]

358
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,120
unlock the door

359
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,320
unlock the door

360
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,600
[Music]

361
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,120
yep

362
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,320
okay so it's working good 

363
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,040
so now we can play music and sound effect

364
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:38,480
and i think the next video will be the final episode of the first half of this tutorial series

367
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:46,480
we will implement on-screen UI and complete this little treasure hunting game

371
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:58,959
thanks for watching and until next time

373
00:16:49,140 --> 00:17:01,040
