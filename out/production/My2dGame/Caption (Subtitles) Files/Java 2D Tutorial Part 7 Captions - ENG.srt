00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,600
hi guys, this is RyiSnow

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,760
last time we implemented collision detection

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:13,440
so now, the player character cannot walk through solid tiles

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:19,600
and this time, we will create some objects and display them on the screen

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,800
so first, we prepare some object images

9
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,680
okay i think... so this is door

10
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:54,280
[Music]

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,280
something like this... so key

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:16,240
[Music]

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,600
okay something like this

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,600
so...treasure chest

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:38,560
[Music]

16
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,600
this is not so bad

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,560
okay so this is boots

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,600
so i have prepared these four objects

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:55,920
so inside of this "res" folder let's create another package

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,560
and i'm gonna name this "objects"

25
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,680
and we're gonna copy these four images to this "objects"

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:18,160
then inside of this source folder, create another package

29
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,160
and name this "object"

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,840
inside of this package, create a class

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,680
and i'm gonna name this SuperObject

36
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:42,080
so this will be a parent class of all object classes that we will create later

39
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:47,440
kind of similar to this Entity class and this Player class

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:53,840
and inside of this SuperObject we declare some classes and object variables

53
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,400
and the default is "false"

57
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,360
and import BufferedImage

58
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,519
alright that's all for now

59
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,799
so let's create an object class

60
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:37,280
so inside of this object package, create a class

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,120
and i'm gonna name it OBJ_Key

65
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:51,760
you can just type Key but i kind of like adding this kind of abbreviation

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,760
so it's really clear that this is an object class

70
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:05,200
and this OBJ_Key class extends SuperObject

75
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,840
and constructor

78
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:19,359
and inside of this constructor, first we set the name

81
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:28,040
and then we're gonna load the image

93
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,160
and here we're gonna type the file path

95
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,400
it's inside of this objects folder so...

103
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,919
okay now let's go to this GamePanel

106
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,880
around here

107
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,960
we're gonna use this SuperObject

111
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,039
and we're gonna use this as an array

115
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,360
the size is... i choose 10

116
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:46,320
so this 10 means, we prepare 10 slots for object

119
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:55,120
so we have 10 slots, but we can replace the content during the game

123
00:05:51,759 --> 00:06:02,160
so this doesn't mean we can only create 10 objects in the game

125
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:06,960
this just means we can display up to 10 objects at the same time

127
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:13,520
for example, if you pick up an objectA, the objectA disappears from the screen

129
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:18,720
so we can add a new object in the vacant slot

131
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:24,560
i just chose 10 because displaying too many objects at the same time can slow down the game

134
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:33,199
but if you think 10 is not enough, you can always increase this number

137
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:39,360
you can decide the number as checking your game's performers

139
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:48,400
alright, next we will instantiate some objects and place them on the map

142
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:52,000
we can do it in this GamePanel class by creating a method

144
00:06:50,880 --> 00:07:01,199
but i think it would be better to create a specific class and let it handle all the placement stuff

148
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:08,560
so inside of this "main" package let's create a class

151
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:17,440
and i'm gonna name this AssetSetter

155
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,840
or whatever name you like

157
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,800
we're gonna use GamePanel

158
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,560
and the constructor

162
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:38,319
so we're gonna receive GamePanel

164
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:49,120
okay so inside of this GamePanel let's instantiate this AssetSetter

166
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,800
maybe after this CollisionChecker

175
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:12,479
and pass this GamePanel class

176
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,479
okay so go back to this AssetSetter

177
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,720
now create a method

181
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:28,479
so here we're gonna instantiate some default objects and place them on the map

184
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:35,839
so we're going to use this object array

190
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,600
we're going to use this key object class

192
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:59,839
since this OBJ_Key is a subclass of this SuperObject class

195
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:04,080
so you can instantiate it as one of this array

197
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,480
and next

200
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:17,680
and here we're gonna set this object's worldX and the worldY

203
00:09:17,760 --> 0:09:26,959
i wanna place this key here

207
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:31,920
in front of this lake or pond

208
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:34,160
let's open this map file

209
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,200
so this point

211
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,320
okay i'm gonna change this to the grass tile

212
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,399
and so col 23 and row seven

222
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,560
okay let's create one more key

224
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,000
so we're gonna put index 1

227
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,000
so one more key

229
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,680
this time i want to place it around here

232
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:57,440
so we instantiated these two keys and also set their default location

237
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,640
now let's call this setObject method

239
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,079
go to GamePanel

240
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,920
somewhere around here

243
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:18,079
i'm gonna name this method setupGame or something like that

245
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:28,399
so from here we're gonna call setObject

248
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:35,760
and we want to call this set object method before this game starts

252
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:43,120
so we're gonna call this setupGame method probably from this Main class

255
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,480
and before starting this game thread so...

260
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,399
yeah so we call this setObject method

261
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:06,320
and now these key objects get its wordX and worldY

263
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:11,040
now let's draw these objects on the screen

265
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,800
to draw these objects, we go to this SuperObject class

267
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,800
and create a draw method here

270
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:30,480
and here we get Graphics2D

275
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,480
and also i think we need GamePanel

278
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,880
alright

279
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:54,639
what we're gonna do here is almost identical to what we did for background tiles

283
00:12:50,839 --> 00:13:04,320
like this one. so we need to find out object's image and screenX and the screenY

287
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:12,240
this time we don't need to do this kind of while loop and scan all the tiles like this

290
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,920
but instead... okay we copy only this part

294
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,079
and paste here

296
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:30,800
and instead of this tile[tileNum].image, just "image"

300
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:36,240
so this one, the object's image

302
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:43,600
other than this, it's same so we don't need to change anything

305
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,320
if we know this object... whatever it is...

306
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,880
if we know this object's worldX and worldY

308
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:56,639
then we can find out it's screenX and screenY based on player's worldX and worldY

310
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,720
and the screen position

311
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,240
so we can draw it on the screen

312
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:07,760
so let's call this draw method

314
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,199
i'll go to this GamePanel class

315
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:15,160
since it's drawing so we go to this paintComponent method

321
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:34,800
yeah i think it should be here, after tile and before player

323
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,240
we're gonna call that draw method in this SuperObject class

325
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:47,519
but this time we cannot simply call it like this or this

329
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:53,440
first we need to know what kind of object we are going to draw

331
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,240
so type like this...

337
00:15:07,680 --> 0:15:17,839
so this obj is... this one so SuperObject array

340
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:28,480
so basically we scan this SuperObject array one by one

349
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,680
we gonna call this draw method

350
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:51,360
and pass Graphics2D and this GamePanel

352
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,600
yeah that's it

353
00:15:51,360 --> 00:16:01,839
this length is 10 so we're gonna scan from 0 to 9

355
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:06,959
and check if any object is inside of this array

357
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:13,600
we need to check if the slot is null or not otherwise we might get a NullPointer error 

359
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,800
so make sure to check it

361
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:27,839
alright so now we should be able to draw objects so let's check

365
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,800
yes, we found a key

367
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,480
this doesn't look so bad

368
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,199
this looks better than i thought

369
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,199
another one

370
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,759
yep another key is here

371
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,759
nothing happens yet though

372
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:58,639
so two keys are displayed so this is working good

374
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,880
okay let's create some more objects

375
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:07,280
so first inside of this object package, create a new class

378
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,679
i'm gonna name this OBJ_Door

381
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,839
and i think we can copy this

389
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,240
and the name is "Door"

390
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,480
we're gonna use this name a bit later

391
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:47,280
and the image is "door"

393
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,320
okay let's create one more class

405
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:18,559
so i'm gonna create three doors and place around here

408
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,280
and also around here

410
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,480
and also here

411
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:33,280
and place the treasure chest around here

414
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,400
okay so AssetSetter

417
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,080
i wanna create one more key

418
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:47,440
and i'm gonna place it somewhere around here

423
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,760
then create 3 doors

432
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,799
and also treasure chest

437
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,280
okay so coordinate

438
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,880
column 10

439
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,000
row 9

443
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,960
and the chest is column 10 and row 7

446
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,200
so let's check this

447
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:09,600
okay so first let's check the third key

450
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,240
oop i was expecting around here so...

454
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:31,200
okay so let's check the doors

456
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,440
okay so doors

457
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,480
the first door

458
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,480
the second door

459
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,080
and oh oh

460
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:47,120
not here it was supposed to be here

461
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:50,640
the chest is okay so let's adjust the placement

463
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,640
so 2 tiles to the bottom

467
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:06,000
okay so door is here and the chest is here

469
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,720
so now we got 3 keys, 3 doors and 1 chest

472
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:17,440
at the beginning of this series, i said we are going to make a simple treasure hunting game

474
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:25,360
and we are closing to the end of the first chapter of this tutorial

477
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:28,080
so the idea is... it's very simple

478
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:33,120
first we pick 3 keys, and open 3 doors, and get the treasure

480
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,640
right now, there is no collision and you can just walk through this door

484
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,520
but we are going to add collision to this door

485
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:51,520
and change the settings so we can open this door only when you have a key

488
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,080
there are 3 doors, so you need 3 keys

489
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:58,520
so that's what we're gonna do next

491
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:10,369
thanks for watching and until next time

00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:10,369
